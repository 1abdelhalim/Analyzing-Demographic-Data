In this project,
we will use Pandas to analyze demographic data from the 1994 Census database. The data contains information on various personal and occupational characteristics of individuals, including their age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, native country, and salary.

Use Pandas to answer the following questions:
How many people of each race are represented in this dataset?
What is the average age of men?
What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
